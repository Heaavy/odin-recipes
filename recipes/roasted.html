                <h4>Step</h4>
                <p>Whisk soy sauce, chili sauce, paprika, parsley, and pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. <br> chicken thighs and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for up to 1 hour.</p>
                
                <h4>Step</h4>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack on the tray.</p>
            
                <h4>Step</h4>
                <p>Remove chicken thighs from the marinade and shake off excess; transfer to the prepared rack. Discard the remaining marinade.</p>

                <h4>Step</h4>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn and continue to bake until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, <br>10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
